# Sales analysis for ValueHub company

## Project Background


ValueHub, since 2014 offers a variety of products to cover all shopping needs in a central location (superstores), while providing
low prices. The company is recognized for its commitment to operational excellence and customer satisfaction.

The organization has a huge quantity of detailed sales data. This project goes deep into that information to inform how the latest year (2017) performed against the previous one (2016).

The insights and recommendations are given in the following key areas:

- Product analysis: Analyze product-related data to extract key performance indicators (KPIs), including the top product by sales (general, segment, and category) and the top product by profit (general, segment, and category).

- Geographical analysis: Analyze location-related data to provide financial metrics at the same level.

- Temporal analysis: Analyze temporal-related data to provide financial metrics at the same level.

### Recomendations

In the light of the previous data, her are my suppositions are recommended for reference:

1. **Enhance Product Portfolio Management**: Even while we still dominate in sales/profit of high-end copying/printing solutions and phones, 
from time to time an examination needs to be made to ascertain emerging trends and falling products.

2. **Geographic Market Optimization**: Growth expenditure and resources should be placed on high-performing cities (such as NYC, Seattle) while maintaining a cost-effective presence in lower-performing areas.

3. **Profitability improvement initiatives**: Major net loss categories, such as Tables and Machine Tools, would require more detailed analysis to uncover the real problems. This might include pricing fluctuations, market demand trends on a general level, or specific operational inefficiencies.

4. **Profit-based inventory management**: Design inventory management methods so that the margin is placed above its volume.
